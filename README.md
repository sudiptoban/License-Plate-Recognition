The following project is based upon Automatic License Plate Recognition(ALPR) using MATLAB.
The code takes in a input which is an image of an Indian vehicle. 
The code processes it and extracts the license plate from the original image. 
The code uses methods like sobel edge detection, morphological operations , making bounding boxes , etc. are applied as a part of initial processing of image.
After extraction of the alphanumeric characters of license plate , template matching approach is used for character recognition.
A simple GUI is constructed for easy use of the whole system by the user. 
The codes for the ALPR system and GUI is present in the repository.
